# City Town Hall Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the data requirements for the Christmas city engines, lights, speakers and every other actionable.\
For detail task information and status we made a [Trello](https://trello.com/b/3zekwBi3/iot-central-hall).

## Actions

### Lights
- **Christmas Tree**
  - Lights up when it’s dark in the room (uses brightness sensor).
- **Star on Christmas Tree**
  - Lights up based on the Christmas tree’s logic or when Santa is nearby (proximity sensor).
- **Village Lights**
  - Blink in response to clapping or noise above a certain threshold.
- **LEDs on Santa’s Track**
  - Light up when Santa is detected as approaching.

### Engines
- **Santa Claus**
  - Motorized movement for Santa’s sleigh.
- **Christmas Tree**
  - Rotates for a dynamic effect.
- **Ferris Wheel**
  - Spins as part of the village decoration in response to the hour.
- **Snow Spray**
  - Activates when the temperature falls below a defined value.

### Speakers
- **City Song**

  - Triggers based on actions (e.g., Santa's arrival).
  - We'll have a set of default songs stored in a SD and we receive the ID of the song to play.
